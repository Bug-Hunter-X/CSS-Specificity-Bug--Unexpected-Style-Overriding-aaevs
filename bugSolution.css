The solution involves carefully considering CSS selector specificity:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green !important; /* Using !important forces this rule to be applied */
}
```

By using `!important`, we explicitly override the default CSS specificity rules.  However, overuse of `!important` is generally discouraged and should be used cautiously as it can complicate CSS maintenance. A better long-term solution might involve restructuring the selectors or using a more specific selector to avoid the conflict.
